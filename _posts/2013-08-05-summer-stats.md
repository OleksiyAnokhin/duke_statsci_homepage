CIT published a blog post on my online and flipped summer course -- Sta 104: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference (Online). Click [here](http://cit.duke.edu/blog/2013/08/summer-statistics-at-duke-online-flipped-and-synchronous/) for the post. Click [here](https://stat.duke.edu/courses/Summer13/sta104.01-1/) for the Summer 2013 course website. Note that this course covers the same material and meets the same requirements as the on-campus Sta 101 course I offer during the regular session.
