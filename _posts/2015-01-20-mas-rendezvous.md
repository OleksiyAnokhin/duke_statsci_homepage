Last fall semester, Sandra van Ginhoven and Hilary Cronheim (DALMI) and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (Statistics) collaborated on a Data Expedition project as part of the Information Initiative at Duke (iiD). Sixteen undergraduate students in Prof Çetinkaya-Rundel's FOCUS course, STA112FS Better Living Through Data Science: Exploring/Modeling/Predicting/Understanding, stepped back into the eighteenth-century Parisian auction market. For the first time, students used this data to understand observed market phenomena, explore patterns, model outcomes, and make predictions about emerging art markets. Prof Çetinkaya-Rundel will share last semester's experience of working on art & markets data with students in Statistics performing exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization using the R statistical computing language.
