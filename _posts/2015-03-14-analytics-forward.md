Spend a Saturday at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina campus learning about the latest techniques, trends, and tools in analytics. Pitch a talk to share your knowledge, or just attend and connect with your peers in the Research Triangle.

Here is [my pitch](http://analyticsforward.org/session-pitch-datafest-a-celebration-of-data/), and if you missed my talk, slides can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gen49e3c7eyoy4h/af2015_datafest.pdf?dl=0).
