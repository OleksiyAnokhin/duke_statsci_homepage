Read the article about my collaboration with Sandra van Ginhoven and Hillary Cronheim (DALMI) for bringing an 18th century art auction dataset into my data science course [here](http://sites.duke.edu/dukeresearch/2015/05/29/what-affordable-art-can-tell-us-about-taste/). This project was supported by [iiD Data Expeditions](http://bigdata.duke.edu/data-expeditions).
