I am an Assistant Professor of the Practice in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of California, Los Angeles, and a B.S. in Actuarial Science from New York University's Stern School of Business. My work focuses on innovation in statistics pedagogy, with an emphasis on student-centered learning, computation, reproducible research, and open-source education.

### Pedagogy

I primarily work on developing pedagogical approaches for teaching statistics with a focus on the introductory statistics classroom, such as active learning, flipped classroom, and team-based learning.  I also work on research projects that aim to assess the effectiveness of these approaches with respect to learning, retention, and self-efficacy.

### Statistical computing

Another area that I am heavily involved in is integrating computation into the undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies and analysis of real and complex datasets. I also work on ways for supplementing classroom approaches to teaching statistical thinking via events like DataFest, annual two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set.

### Open-access education

I am also very active in open access education. I have co-authored three open-source statistics textbooks as part of the OpenIntro project at the introductory college and advanced high school level. Also as part of the open education effort, I have been developing and teaching various massive open online courses.

### Applied statistics research

My applied statistics research is mostly driven by interdisciplinary collaborations that arise from statistical consulting. Recently I have worked closely with evolutionary anthropologists on a project using hierarchical modeling, and with medical school researchers on a variety of applied problems.
